-- Nestegg: Bank account linking + real payouts via Paystack Transfers
-- Run this AFTER all previous schema files.
--
-- This is the first flow where money actually LEAVES the platform, so the
-- pattern is deliberately conservative: reserve (deduct) the funds and
-- create a 'pending' ledger row FIRST, then attempt the Paystack transfer.
-- If the transfer fails at any point — the API call itself, or later via
-- webhook — the reservation is refunded. The wallet balance can never
-- reflect money that both left the wallet AND never left the platform.

-- 1. Bank accounts -----------------------------------------------------------
create table if not exists public.bank_accounts (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid not null references public.profiles(id) on delete cascade,

  paystack_recipient_code text not null unique,

-- 2. Extend wallet_transactions to reference a bank account on withdrawals --
alter table public.wallet_transactions
  add column if not exists bank_account_id uuid references public.bank_accounts(id) on delete set null;

-- 3. Reserve a withdrawal ------------------------------------------------------
-- Called by the authenticated user via RPC. Deducts the wallet balance
-- immediately and creates a 'pending' ledger row — the debit happens here,
-- BEFORE any Paystack API call, so the balance always reflects "this money
-- is either gone or in-flight," never double-counted.

-- 4. Resolve a reserved withdrawal ---------------------------------------------
-- Service-role only — called from the API route (if the Paystack transfer
-- call fails synchronously) or the webhook (once Paystack confirms success
-- or failure asynchronously). Idempotent: a transaction that's already
-- resolved is left alone, so a webhook retry can't double-refund or
-- double-confirm.

-- 7. Notify on withdrawal resolution -------------------------------------------
-- The existing wallet_transactions_notify trigger (schema_notifications.sql)
-- only fires on INSERT — a bank withdrawal starts 'pending' at insert time
-- and only becomes 'success'/'failed' via resolve_withdrawal()'s UPDATE, so
-- it needs its own trigger on that transition.
