## How money moves (important)

Every amount is stored in **kobo** (1 NGN = 100 kobo) to avoid float
rounding — the same unit Paystack's API uses.

Wallet balances and goal amounts are **never updated directly** by client
code. Three Postgres functions in `schema_savings_wallet.sql` are the only
way money moves:

- `credit_wallet` — called only by the service role (the Paystack webhook
  and the payment-callback page), never by a logged-in user's session.
  Idempotent on the Paystack reference, so a webhook retry or the callback
  page running right after the webhook never double-credits.
- `transfer_to_goal` / `withdraw_from_goal` — callable by the logged-in
  user, but use `auth.uid()` internally rather than trusting a client-passed
  user id, so no one can move funds on someone else's behalf.

Row Level Security on `wallets` and `savings_goals` grants **read-only**
access to authenticated users — there is deliberately no UPDATE policy, so
even a compromised or malicious client can't PATCH a balance directly
through the Supabase API. Only these functions (running with elevated
privileges) can.

## Setup

1. **Run the schema, in order.** In Supabase → SQL Editor:
   `supabase/schema.sql` → `supabase/schema_savings_wallet.sql` →
   `supabase/schema_otp.sql` → `supabase/schema_community.sql` →
   `supabase/schema_admin.sql` → `supabase/schema_notifications.sql` →
   `supabase/schema_bank_accounts.sql` → `supabase/schema_referral.sql` →
   `supabase/schema_rewards.sql` → `supabase/schema_kyc.sql` →
   `supabase/schema_settings.sql` → `supabase/schema_login_security.sql`.
   These now include the `GRANT` statements a fresh project needs — see
   the note below if you're patching an already-running project instead
   of starting clean.

2. **Turn OFF "Confirm email."** In Supabase → Authentication → Providers →
   Email, disable "Confirm email." Verification is now handled entirely by
   your own `otp_codes` table and the `/api/otp/*` routes — Supabase's
   built-in confirmation would otherwise also try to gate sign-in and
   conflict with this flow. `signUp()` now returns an active session
   immediately; the middleware separately checks `profiles.email_verified`
   before letting anyone into `/onboarding` or `/dashboard`.

3. **Get a Resend account** (resend.com) for sending the email code, and a
   **Termii account** (termii.com) for the SMS code — or swap `lib/sms.ts`
   for whichever gateway you prefer.

4. **Get a Paystack account.** paystack.com → Settings → API Keys &
   Webhooks. Copy the **test secret key** for development, and set the
   webhook URL to `https://yourdomain.com/api/paystack/webhook`.

5. **Copy env vars.**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in Supabase URL/anon key/service role key, `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`,
   `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, and `TERMII_API_KEY` +
   `TERMII_SENDER_ID`.

6. **Install and run.**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Deploy.** Push to GitHub, Vercel picks it up from the repo root. Add
   all env vars in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables.

## A gotcha worth knowing about

Tables created by running raw SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor do **not**
automatically get the table-level `GRANT`s that tables created through the
dashboard's Table Editor receive. RLS policies only control *which rows* a
role can see — the role still needs a base `GRANT` to touch the table at
all. Without it, Postgres rejects every query with `permission denied for
table X`, before RLS is ever evaluated. If you add a new table by hand
later, remember to also `grant select` (and `insert`/`update` as needed) to
`authenticated` — see `supabase/migration_grant_authenticated_privileges.sql`
for the pattern.

## A security fix you must run if you set this up before the Profile feature

**Run `supabase/migration_restrict_profile_column_updates.sql` now if you
haven't already.** The original grant on `profiles` gave `authenticated`
`UPDATE` on the whole table, which — unlike an RLS policy — silently
covers every column added later too, including `role`, `kyc_status`,
`email_verified`, and `phone_verified`. Until this migration is run, any
logged-in user could open the browser console and run
`supabase.from('profiles').update({ role: 'admin' })` on their own row and
grant themselves admin access, or fake their own KYC/verification status.
This is folded into `schema.sql` for fresh installs, but an
already-running project needs the migration applied by hand.

## How verification works now

Sign up → account is created (session starts immediately since Supabase's
own confirmation is off) → `/api/otp/request` generates a code server-side
and emails it via Resend → `/auth/verify` calls `/api/otp/verify`, which
flips `profiles.email_verified` → middleware lets the user past
`/onboarding` and `/dashboard` only once that flag is true. Phone
verification works the same way, offered as an optional step inside
onboarding, sent via Termii.

## Testing a deposit

Paystack's test mode accepts card `4084 0840 8408 4081`, any future expiry,
any CVV, OTP `123456`. After checkout you'll land on
`/dashboard/wallet/callback`, which verifies the transaction and credits
your wallet immediately — the webhook then fires separately and is a safe
no-op since crediting is idempotent.

## What community forum adds

`supabase/schema_community.sql` — posts, comments, likes, groups, and a
weekly savings leaderboard view. Like/comment counts are kept accurate by
database triggers rather than app-level increments, so two people liking
the same post at once can't corrupt the count. RLS lets any signed-in user
read everything, but only the author of a post/comment can delete it, and
only the security-definer triggers can touch the like/comment counters —
matching the same pattern used everywhere else in this project.

```
app/dashboard/community/
  page.tsx              Feed — posts, group chips, weekly leaderboard
  new/                  Create a post, optionally to a group
  [postId]/             Post detail with comments
  group-chips.tsx        Join/leave a community group
  like-button.tsx         Optimistic like toggle
app/api/community/
  posts/                 Create a post
  posts/[postId]/like     Toggle a like
  posts/[postId]/comments Add a comment
  groups/[groupId]/join   Toggle group membership
```

## What the admin panel adds

`supabase/schema_admin.sql` — adds a `role` column to `profiles`
(`'user'` or `'admin'`), settable **only** via a manual `UPDATE` in the SQL
editor — there's no signup flow, API route, or UI button that can ever
grant it. Admin routes check the caller's own role via their normal
session (`lib/admin-auth.ts`), then do the actual privileged read/write
through the service-role client — rather than adding RLS policies that
would let any authenticated session query everyone's rows directly.

```
app/admin/
  page.tsx               Overview — user counts, KYC queue, totals under management
  users/                 Full user list, filterable by pending KYC
  users/[userId]/         Profile detail + approve/reject KYC
  community/              Moderation — delete any post
app/api/admin/
  users/[userId]/kyc/     Approve/reject a user's KYC
  community/posts/[id]/   Admin delete for any post
lib/admin-auth.ts          Shared requireAdminUser() check
```

**To make yourself an admin**, after running `schema_admin.sql`, run in the
SQL editor:
```sql
update public.profiles set role = 'admin' where id = '<your-user-uuid>';
```
Find your ID with the query in the comments at the bottom of that file.
Then visit `/admin` — ordinary users get redirected straight back to
`/dashboard` if they try.

## What notifications adds

`supabase/schema_notifications.sql` — a `notifications` table, populated
entirely by database triggers on tables that already exist, not by app
code calling an insert after the fact (so a notification can never happen
without the real event, and can't be faked by calling an API directly):

- A deposit or goal withdrawal lands in `wallet_transactions` → trigger
  fires → notification created.
- Someone comments or likes your community post → trigger fires →
  notification created (skips your own likes/comments on your own post).
- A daily cron job (`/api/cron/savings-reminders`, scheduled in
  `vercel.json`) finds users with an active goal who haven't transferred
  anything to it in 7+ days and haven't already been reminded in the last
  7, creates an in-app notification, and sends a nudge email via Resend.

Marking a notification read goes through a column-restricted grant —
same pattern as the profile security fix — so a user can flip their own
`read_at` but can never rewrite a notification's title or body.

```
components/notification-bell.tsx   Bell icon with live unread-count dot
app/dashboard/notifications/       Full list, mark-as-read
app/api/notifications/              Mark one / mark all read
app/api/cron/savings-reminders/     Scheduled reminder job
```

**Setup**: run `supabase/schema_notifications.sql`, add `CRON_SECRET` to
your env vars (Vercel sends it automatically as the cron job's auth
header — see `.env.local.example`). Note: Vercel's free Hobby plan only
runs cron jobs once a day, which is exactly what this one needs, so no
upgrade required.

## What bank account linking + withdrawals adds

Until now, money could come INTO the platform (Paystack deposits) but
never actually leave it — `withdraw_from_goal` only moved money from a
goal back into the in-app wallet. `supabase/schema_bank_accounts.sql`
adds real payouts via Paystack Transfers.

Because this is the first flow where money genuinely leaves the platform,
the sequencing is deliberately conservative:

1. **Reserve first** — `reserve_withdrawal()` deducts the wallet balance
   and creates a `'pending'` ledger row *before* any Paystack API call.
   The balance can never reflect money that's simultaneously gone from the
   wallet and never sent.
2. **Attempt the transfer** — `/api/wallet/withdraw-to-bank` calls
   Paystack's transfer API. If that call fails outright (network error,
   Paystack rejects it, or the account has OTP-for-transfers enabled,
   which a customer-facing flow can't complete), the reservation is
   refunded immediately via `resolve_withdrawal(..., false)`.
3. **Webhook resolves it** — `transfer.success` / `transfer.failed` /
   `transfer.reversed` events are the actual source of truth, matched by
   the transaction's own ID (passed as Paystack's `reference` when
   initiating). A refund on failure, a confirmation on success.

Adding a bank account requires Paystack to resolve the account number to
a real account name first (`/api/bank-accounts/resolve`) — you can't save
an account you haven't verified actually exists. Withdrawals also require
`kyc_status = 'verified'`, enforced inside `reserve_withdrawal()` itself,
not just in the UI.

```
app/dashboard/wallet/bank-accounts/  List, add (with verification), remove
app/dashboard/wallet/withdraw/       Withdraw to a linked account
app/api/banks/                        Bank list for the dropdown
app/api/bank-accounts/                Resolve, create, delete
app/api/wallet/withdraw-to-bank/      Reserve + initiate transfer
```

**One Paystack setting to check**: Settings → Preferences → Transfers —
make sure OTP-for-transfers is OFF, or every withdrawal will fail with
the OTP error message above (that OTP goes to the business's registered
phone, which a customer flow has no way to enter).

Every planned slice from the original flowchart is now built, plus this
refinement. From here it's whatever surfaces as you actually use it —
a referral system, badges/rewards, or fixes to anything above.

## Design system: dark mode + desktop layout

Colors that mean "surface, text, border, background" are now CSS
variables (`app/globals.css`), switched by a `.dark` class on `<html>` —
so `bg-surface`, `text-navy`, `text-ink`, `border-line` etc. automatically
flip everywhere they're used, with zero changes needed to individual
pages. Brand accents (`blue`, `blue-deep`, `success`, `amber`, and a
static `brand-navy` reserved for gradients) stay constant across both
themes.

- `components/theme-toggle.tsx` — the switch, in Profile → Dark mode.
  Preference is saved to `localStorage` and applied via an inline script
  in `app/layout.tsx` that runs before paint, so there's no flash of the
  wrong theme on load.
- `components/app-shell.tsx` — on screens wider than ~900px, the app
  renders as a fixed-width (440px) card centered on a soft decorative
  background, instead of stretching full-bleed. Applied to
  `/dashboard/*`, `/auth/*`, and `/onboarding/*` layouts. **Deliberately
  NOT applied to `/admin`**, which is meant to use the full desktop width
  like a normal web app, not the phone-width shell.
- The splash page (`app/page.tsx`) gets its own full-bleed two-column
  treatment on desktop — marketing copy and feature highlights on the
  left, the sign-up/log-in card on the right — rather than being
  squeezed into the phone-width shell, since a landing page benefits from
  more room to make the case for the app.

## What the referral program adds

`supabase/schema_referral.sql` — every profile gets a short referral code
(auto-generated, `profiles.referral_code`). The reward — ₦500 — fires on
the **referred person's first successful deposit**, not on signup alone;
rewarding signup would be trivially gameable (create accounts, refer
yourself), while requiring real money to move means they actually became
a user. A referral code can be captured via a `?ref=CODE` link
(`/dashboard/referral` has a one-tap copy button for exactly this) or
typed in manually on the signup form.

## What rewards & badges adds

`supabase/schema_rewards.sql` — six badges, all awarded automatically by
database triggers on events that were already happening (first deposit,
first goal created, a goal fully funded, KYC verified, first community
post, first successful referral) — never by app code manually granting
one, so a badge can't be faked by calling an API directly. `/dashboard/rewards`
shows all badges, locked ones dimmed with a 🔒 until earned.

## What real KYC (BVN verification) adds

`supabase/schema_kyc.sql` replaces the self-attested KYC path with actual
verification. **Note:** this originally used Paystack's `resolve_bvn`
lookup, which turned out to be deprecated (it now returns "not
available"). It's rebuilt on Paystack's current endpoint,
`POST /bvn/match`, which works differently — it doesn't return raw
personal data at all. Instead you send a BVN *and* a bank account number,
and it returns `true`/`false` for whether the account and name actually
match that BVN. That's why `/dashboard/kyc` requires linking a bank
account first (`/dashboard/wallet/bank-accounts`) rather than asking for
a typed date of birth — the account is the thing being matched against.
Costs ₦15/call as of writing, with 10 free calls/month — check current
Paystack pricing before high volume. The admin approve/reject flow
(`/admin/users/[userId]`) still exists as a manual override for edge
cases.

A `is_blacklisted: true` result is treated as a hard rejection (sets
`kyc_status = 'rejected'`, not just "no match") — that's a real
compliance signal Paystack is telling you about, not a typo to retry.

Two real safeguards came with this, not just the verification itself:

- **Rate-limited attempts** — 5 BVN checks per user per 24 hours
  (`kyc_verification_attempts`), so this can't be used to brute-force
  guess whose BVN belongs to a given bank account.
- **Tiered deposit caps** — until `kyc_status = 'verified'`, a wallet's
  balance is capped at ₦50,000 (`get_deposit_cap_kobo`), a rough analogue
  of Nigeria's CBN tiered KYC framework. This is enforced in
  `/api/paystack/initialize`, checked **before** the Paystack charge
  starts — rejecting it after payment succeeds would mean the customer's
  money is taken but stuck, since crediting a confirmed charge always
  has to succeed.

## What two-factor authentication adds

Built on Supabase's native TOTP support (`supabase.auth.mfa`) rather than
a custom implementation — it's free, enabled by default on every
Supabase project, and battle-tested.

- `/dashboard/profile/security/2fa` — enroll (scan a QR code with any
  authenticator app), confirm with a 6-digit code, or remove it later.
- `/auth/mfa-challenge` — after a correct password, an account with a
  verified authenticator needs this second step before reaching anything
  protected. Checked in **both** the login page and `middleware.ts`, so a
  session that hasn't completed the challenge (e.g., a closed tab
  mid-flow) can't reach `/dashboard` by navigating there directly.

If `enroll()` ever fails outright, double check Authentication → Settings
in the Supabase dashboard for an MFA toggle — it should be on by default,
but dashboard defaults can vary.

## Background video/image on splash, login, and signup — now a real CMS

`components/media-background.tsx` wraps these three pages in a full-bleed
video (with an image poster/fallback) and a dark overlay for text
legibility. There are now two ways to supply the media, checked in this
order:

1. **`/admin/media`** — upload directly from the admin panel. Files go
   into a public Supabase Storage bucket (`app-media`), and the resulting
   URL is saved to a small `app_settings` table
   (`supabase/schema_settings.sql`). Changes apply immediately, no
   deploy needed. Video capped at 4MB (Vercel's serverless request body
   limit is ~4.5MB), image at 1MB. A "Reset" button on each clears the
   override and falls back to whatever's next.
2. **Local files** — `public/videos/auth-bg.mp4` and
   `public/images/auth-bg.jpg`, used automatically if nothing's been
   uploaded via the admin panel.

If neither exists, it falls back to the plain gradient these pages had
before this feature existed — nothing breaks with zero assets supplied
either way. `app_settings` is readable by anyone, including logged-out
visitors — the splash page loads before anyone's signed in — but only
writable through the admin upload route, never directly by a client.

See the `README.txt` in `public/videos/` and `public/images/` for
recommended specs and where to find free, properly-licensed stock
video/photos (Pexels, Coverr, Unsplash) if you're using the local-file
path instead of uploading through the admin panel.

## Forgot password

Standard Supabase recovery flow: `/auth/forgot-password` requests a reset
link via `resetPasswordForEmail`, `/auth/reset-password` handles the
callback and sets a new password. The request page always shows the same
"check your email" success state regardless of whether the address is
registered — confirming or denying that would leak which emails have
accounts.

## Two other fixes in this batch

- **Bottom nav icons** — these were plain filled circles the whole time,
  not real icons. Replaced with actual per-tab SVGs
  (`components/bottom-nav.tsx`).
- **Community posts silently not showing** — same root-cause pattern as
  the middleware bug earlier: the page only destructured `data` from the
  Supabase query, discarding any `error`, so a failed query looked
  identical to an empty feed. Now surfaces the real error on screen. The
  most likely actual cause: `supabase/migration_reload_schema_cache.sql`
  — PostgREST caches foreign-key relationships and doesn't always notice
  a schema change made via the SQL Editor (like the
  `community_posts.user_id → profiles` fix from earlier) without being
  told to reload.

## Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and signup consent

`/terms` and `/privacy` are real pages now, not just links to nowhere —
**but they're drafts, not legal documents.** Both have a visible banner
saying so. This app collects BVN data and moves real money to bank
accounts, which carries real regulatory exposure in Nigeria (CBN
licensing, NDPA 2023 data protection obligations, AML/CFT rules) — have
these reviewed by a lawyer before real users rely on them, and fill in
the `[bracketed placeholders]` (fees, retention periods, contact info)
once those are actually decided.

Signup now requires checking a box agreeing to both before the account
can be created. Consent is recorded server-side at the moment of
signup — `profiles.terms_accepted_at` and `terms_version` — via
`handle_new_user()`, not by a direct client update (consistent with the
column-security fix from earlier: a user can't set this themselves after
the fact). If you update the terms later, bump the version string in the
trigger so you can tell who agreed to which version.

## Login rate limiting

Password login now goes through `/api/auth/login` instead of the browser
calling Supabase directly — that's what makes rate limiting possible.
Tracked by email (not IP, so switching networks doesn't bypass it): 5
failed attempts in 15 minutes locks out further tries against that
email until the window passes. This closes a real gap — OTP and KYC
attempts were already rate-limited, but password login itself wasn't,
meaning someone could brute-force a password with unlimited tries.

`supabase/schema_login_security.sql` also folds in one more redefinition
of `handle_new_user()` — it's been extended a few times now (wallet
creation, referral tracking, terms consent) — this file has the current,
complete version.

## Required Supabase privilege migration

If a server-side onboarding/profile request reports `42501 permission denied for table profiles` while the database says the current role is `service_role`, run:

`supabase/migration_service_role_profiles_grants.sql`

This grants the trusted `service_role` the minimum `profiles` table privileges required by the server-side onboarding route. It does not grant browser users direct write access and does not disable RLS.
